                            I am amazed by the M1 processor.  Nearly 2x faster, perfectly silent, cool to touch. I purchased the M1 shortly after their announcement and don't regret it.
                            The decrease in RAM from 64GB to 16GB has surprisingly not been impactful.

                            My previous setup was a Mac mini (2018) that would regularly push 90W of power, and an eGPU that would push 200W+... leaving my office  
                            hot and noisy from fans. This is <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx_5700-rx_5700_xt,6216-5.html">150-1,250 BTU</a> vs <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201897">25-130BTU</a> with the M1. ðŸ™‚

                            I love low-travel keys, and this keyboard doesn't disappoint.  I also appreciate not having a numpad, to reduce the amount of travel my arm 
                            has to make to reach the mouse.  This transition happens a lot, and I've found reducing this motion helps with RSI. I'm only waiting for Apple to release a new version with the latest

                            I found early on that staring at a bright, blue tinted screen all day and many nights can really strain your eyes.  Not only do I run my monitors as 50% brightness and contrast, 
                            but Flux removes the blue from the screen and greatly reduces eye strain.
